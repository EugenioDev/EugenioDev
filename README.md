### Hi there 👋, I'm Eugenio
Graphic e Web Developer

### Who Am I 
I am a sociable and dynamic person.
My background started with a passion for graphics and in particular for brand design.
Later my studies moved towards client-side web development.

Fascinated by this world, I decided to focus and improve more and more every day trying to achieve everything that came into my mind, from the simple "popup" to the creation of a (more or less complex) WeatherApp

I love programming in Vanilla Javascript because it is fascinating what it allows you to do when the ideas in mind are clear about what you want to achieve, despite its complexity.

This leads me every day to push myself further and never give up.
Keep practicing even just writing a meager line of code a day.

### Skills:
* ✍ HTML
* 🖌 CSS
* 💻 JAVASCRIPT
